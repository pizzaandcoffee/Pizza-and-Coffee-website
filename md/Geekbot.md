### Documentation

----------------

The Documentation can be found in the docs folder | **Outdated \***

The Code itself is also pretty well documentated and there are a lot
of different [example modules here](https://github.com/runebaas/Geekbot-Modules)

\* Even though the docs are outdated because of the current code restructuring, most of it should still give you a general idea of how everything works
